# Android Client for SmartChats (Instant Messaging App integrated with a Virtual Assistant)

Thesis And LPSMT Project for Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at University of Trento.

How to use the client app (2 possible ways):
1) Install the generated updated apk from the relative folder (quick)
2) Setup your Android Studio environment to compile the apk on your own (complete, allows checking and editing the code)

NB: Facebook doesn't allow you to check for friends who didn't install the app. I suggest to use these FB dummy accounts for testing purposes:
1) dummy1@10host.top - psw ”dummy01”  - Mario Rossi
2) dummy2@10host.top - psw ”dummy02”  - Giulia De Franceschi


How to setup:
1) Clone or Download the GitHub Project and import it to your Android Studio IDE.
2) Check for sdk and libraries dependencies to be updated in the Gradle files.
3) Compile and run your app. Be aware the author may have updated the supported client version and you could be using an outdated one. Contact him for further information.
4) You need to have a Facebook account and a working Internet connection to run this app. Also, you may need to enable GPS location to improve your experience at some point.
